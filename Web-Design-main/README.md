# Web-Design

This project is a gym website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the basic structure, including sections like the homepage, about us, classes, trainers, and contact info. CSS makes the site look good and work well on different devices. JavaScript adds interactive features like a menu that works on mobile, class schedules, and form checks. The goal is to create an easy-to-use and attractive website for gym members and potential clients.
